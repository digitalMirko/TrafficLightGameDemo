Swift - Traffic Light Game Demo App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone X Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Traffic Light Game Demo' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a colorful city background with traffic shown as streaks of light. On the top is a blank traffic light
which has the typical Red, Yellow, Green light sequence option. In the middle of the page is a clock and on the bottom a
big red button with the text 'Start' in the center. 

As the user clicks the 'Start' button the traffic light counts down using its lights from Red to Yellow then Green in a 
sequence moving from right to left. Once the green light is shown the timer in the middle starts to count up as the 
'Start' button changes to a 'Stop' button. The counter can only be stopped by clicking the button again which is now a
'Stop' Button. After the counter stops the 'Stop' button becomes a 'Restart' button so you can try another round again to 
improve your score.

The idea behid the game is to seehow fast can you click the button. Great game for family and friends to play together and
see who is the champion. Note: there are built in options to prevent cheating so you can't just click at any times.
